\section{Theoretical Background}
\subsection{The macroscopic description}\label{Macroscopic}
The motion of fluids may be described macroscopically using the  Navier--Stokes equation.\cite{simpleLiquids} 
This models liquids as a continuous medium and combines the conservation of mass and momentum with the relation between the force on a volume element and the local fluid flow.
In the low Reynolds-number regime the flow velocity is small and the Navier--Stokes equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
\label{NavierStokes}
\eta \nabla^{2}\mathbf{\nu}(r,t) = \nabla P(r,t) - \mathbf{f}(r).
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{NavierStokes} shows that motion in fluids \textit{can only} occur under the presence of a pressure gradient or external forces.
In the case of Marangoni flows, motion due to the temperature gradient must result from induced local pressure gradients, which may be derived from thermodynamics.

Consider a binary--mixture with an interface at $z=0$.
The Gibbs--Duhem equation gives
\begin{equation}
V \mathrm{d}P = \sum_{i=0}^{n} N_{i} \mathrm{d}\mu_{i} + S \mathrm{d}T.
\end{equation}
The bulk fluid pressure is constant and isotropic, giving
\begin{equation}
\label{GibbsDuhem}
\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\right) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \rho_{i}^{\mathrm{B}} \left(\frac{\partial \mu_{i}}{\partial x}\right) + \frac{S}{V} \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right) = 0.
\end{equation}
The Maxwell relations relate the entropy to the partial differential of chemical potential with respect to temperature through
\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\partial\mu_{i}}{\partial T} \right)_{P,N_{i}} = - \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial N_{i}}\right)_{P,T}.
\end{equation}
The total entropy is the weighted sum of the partial entropy of the species in the system, 
\begin{equation}
S = \sum_{i=0}^{n}s_{i}N_{i},
\end{equation}
thus
\begin{equation}
\left( \frac{\partial\mu_{i}}{\partial T} \right)_{P,N_{i}} = - s_{i}.
\end{equation}
\\
This allows Equation \ref{GibbsDuhem} to be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\left( - \sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{i}^{\mathrm{B}}s_{i}^{\mathrm{B}}+\frac{S^{\mathrm{B}}}{V}\right)\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right) = 0,
\end{equation}
for which the solution is 
\begin{equation}
\frac{S^{\mathrm{B}}}{V} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{i}^{\mathrm{B}}s_{i}^{\mathrm{B}}.
\end{equation}
\\
Consider the case close to an interface or surface where the pressure will deviate from its bulk value.
Since $\mu_{i}$ and T are independent of $z$,
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\partial \mu_{i}}{\partial T}\right) = - s_{i}^{\mathrm{B}},
\end{equation}
and the pressure gradient reduces to
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\partial P(z,x)}{\partial x}\right) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{i}(z)\left(s_{i}(z)-s_{i}^{\mathrm{B}}\right)\right)\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right).
\label{PressGrad}
\end{equation}

For an ideal mixture, the partial entropy is given by $s_{i}=\frac{1}{T} \left(\mu_{i}-h_{i} \right)$, and thus Equation \ref{PressGrad} can be expressed in terms of the excess enthalpy density, $\Delta h(z)$,
\begin{equation}
\label{ExcessEnthalpy}
\left(\frac{\partial P(z,x)}{\partial x}\right)= - \Delta h(z)\frac{1}{T} \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right) 
= - \Delta h(z) \left( \frac{\partial \ln T}{\partial x} \right).
\end{equation}

Substituting Equation \ref{ExcessEnthalpy} into Equation \ref{NavierStokes} and assuming there is no pressure gradient in the $z$ or $y$ direction allows the velocity, $v(z)$, at the interface to be computed as
\begin{equation}
\label{DoubleIntegral}
v (z=0) = - \frac{1}{\eta}\int_{0}^{\infty} \mathrm{d}z\, z \Delta h(z) \frac{\partial T}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
where it has been assumed that the fluid in the bulk is at rest ($v_{x}(z=\infty)=0$) is at rest.
This expression is almost equivalent to that derived by Derjaguin et. al., except for a factor of two, suggesting there may be an error in Derjaguin's approach.\cite{SurfaceForces, Anderson}

\subsection{A microscopic approach}
The Marangoni effect is a phenomenon occurring on microscopic length--scales, and hence this macroscopic hydrodynamic approach is not entirely appropriate.
Instead of solving the Navier--Stokes equation, the velocity should be related directly to the local forces acting on the fluid, which may be calculated from the local stress tensor,
\begin{equation}
\label{ForceStress}
f_{x}(z) = - \left( \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}(z,x)}{\partial x} \right).
\end{equation}

In the case of Marangoni flows, the force is due to a temperature gradient and $f_{x}(z)$ can be calculated from the chain rule as
\begin{equation}
\label{ForceStressTemp}
f_{x}(z) = - \left( \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}(z,x)}{\partial T} \right) \left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \right).
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Finite Difference Approach}
Equation \ref{ForceStressTemp} shows that the force due to a temperature gradient can be inferred from the temperature variation of the stress tensor. 
To first order, the temperature gradient of the stress tensor can be calculated using a finite difference approach as
\begin{equation}
\label{FinDiff}
\left( \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}(z,x)}{\partial T} \right) \approx \frac{\sigma_{xx}^{T_{2}}(z,x) - \sigma_{xx}^{T_{1}}(z,x)}{T_{2} - T_{1}}.
\end{equation}
Using this approximation, the Marangoni flow profile can be computed as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compute $\sigma_{xx}(z)$ for an equilibrium system at a given temperature $T_{1}$.
	\item Repeat the calculation for another equilibrium system at a slightly higher temperate $T_{2}$.
	\item Approximate the partial derivative of the transverse stress with respect to temperature using the finite difference, Equation \ref{FinDiff}.
	\item Infer $f_{x}(z)$ for a specified value of $\partial T / \partial x$ using Equation \ref{ForceStressTemp} to calculate a force profile.
	\item Compute the flow profile by applying $f_{x}(z)$ as an artificial body force to an equilibrium simulation at an intermediate temperature $T_{3}$ (where $T_{1} < T_{3} < T_{2}$).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-uniqueness of the pressure tensor}
The stress tensor is intimately related to the pressure tensor through
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\alpha \beta}(\mathbf{r}) = - P_{\alpha \beta} (\mathbf{r}).
\end{equation}
The pressure tensor is composed of a kinetic contribution, arising from the momentum transfer of particles on the container walls, and a potential contribution attributed to the interparticle forces.\cite{VarnikBinder}
The kinetic part may be calculated from the ideal gas contribution,
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{P}^{K}(\mathbf{r})=k_{\mathrm{B}} T \rho(\mathbf{r}) \hat{\mathbf{I}},
\end{equation}
whilst the potential contribution cannot be uniquely defined.

For a homogeneous fluid the stress tensor is isotropic, with each diagonal element equal to $- P$, where $P$ is the bulk hydrostatic pressure. 
This pressure can be calculated using the Virial equation, originally derived from the Virial theorem of Clausius\cite{Clausius}, (although also derivable by differentiating the canonical partition function\cite{MolTheoryCap}) to give
\begin{equation}
\label{VirialPressure}
P_{\alpha \beta}(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{V} \left( -m(\mathbf{r})\left< \nu_{\alpha} \nu_{\beta} \right> + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i}^{N} \sum_{j \neq i}^{N} (r_{\alpha}^{(i)} - r_{\alpha}^{(j)})f_{\beta}^{ij} \right).
\end{equation}
Clausius' formulation calculates the local pressure by considering the forces acting on particles located within a volume element at $\mathbf{r}$.

In an inhomogeneous system there is an ambiguity over which particles should contribute to the force at a given position.\cite{MolTheoryCap,VarnikBinder,Rowlinson1982}
This was first reported by Irving and Kirkwood\cite{IrvingKirkwood1949,IrvingKirkwood1950} who describe an alternative method that computes the pressure tensor from the forces acting across an infinitesimal surface $\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}$ located at $\mathbf{r}$.
They calculate the local pressure tensor using only pairs of particles for which the line connecting their centers of mass passes through $\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}$.
For planar systems, such as those involving an interface in the $(x,y)$ plane, the pressure tensor depends only on the distance from this interface and the normal and tangential components can be expressed as
\begin{align}
\label{IKpressureN}
P_{\mathrm{N}}^{\mathrm{IK}}(z) &= \rho(z)k_{\mathrm{B}}T-\frac{1}{2A} \left< \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{|z_{ij}|}{r_{ij}} U'(r_{ij}) \Theta \left( \frac{z-z_{i}}{z_{ij}}\right) \Theta \left( \frac{z_{j} - z}{z_{ij}} \right) \right>,\\
\label{IKpressureT}
P_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{IK}}(z) &= \rho(z)k_{\mathrm{B}}T-\frac{1}{4A} \left< \sum_{i \neq j} \frac{x^{2}_{ij} + y^{2}_{ij}}{r_{ij}} \frac{U'(r_{ij})}{|z_{ij}|} \Theta \left( \frac{z-z_{i}}{z_{ij}}\right) \Theta \left( \frac{z_{j} - z}{z_{ij}} \right) \right>.
\end{align}

The Irving--Kirkwood stress has key advantages over the Virial method for studying confined systems, in particular it yields a normal component independent of local fluctuations in the number density.
Density fluctuations occur close to walls due to structural layering of the fluid, and there is reduced density at liquid--liquid interfaces from the finite width of the interfacial region.
As a result, oscillations in the normal component of the Virial pressure are observed in such systems\cite{VarnikBinder} whilst the Irving--Kirkwood pressure yields a constant normal component, equal to the bulk hydrostatic pressure.
This is more consistent with the expected result since the fluid is isotropic in the direction normal to the surface.
