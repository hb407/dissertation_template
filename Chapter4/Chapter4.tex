\section{Results and Discussion}
\subsection{Binary--mixture confined between two walls}\label{Piston}
Initially, a binary--mixture of two fluids confined between two walls was studied. 
The fluid was prepared as described in Section \ref{SystemPrep} at a pressure of $P^{*} = 0.1$ and temperatures of $T^{*} = 0.8$ and $T^{*} = 0.9$.
The confining walls were used as a piston to control the pressure.

\subsubsection{Using the Virial stress}\label{VirialStressPiston}
Once equilibrated, the simulations were run for $40 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps of length $0.001\ \tau$ and the number density and Virial stress tensor were computed on every timestep.
These values were then time-averaged to produce profiles for the number density and $\sigma(z')$ as shown in Figures \ref{PisVirRho} and \ref{PisVirStress}.

The bulk density is uniform, representing a fluid state, and the interface manifests itself as a sharp change in the densities of the two fluids.
Structural layering of the fluid creates oscillations in the density close to the walls.

Both the normal and tangential stress show bulk values equal to $-P_{ext}$, representing the hydrostatic pressure.
There is a peak in the tangential stress at the interface due to the anisotropy of the interparticle forces in this region.
This can be related to the surface tension and its temperature dependence is the driving force for the Marangoni effect.
There is also a change in the normal component at the interface, resulting from the dependence of the Virial stress on density deviations.
Towards the wall there are temperature dependent oscillations in both components, providing the origin of the thermophoretic force.
}
\label{PisVirStress}
\end{figure*}

Both the density profile and the stress profile show the expected features of a binary--mixture. 
There is a uniform density in the bulk of the fluid and an interfacial region of finite width where the density of one species falls sharply and the density of the other increases.
Close to the walls, there are large oscillations in the density as a consequence of structural layering in the fluid close to the solid.

For the stress profile, the bulk values for the normal and tangential components are equal to $-P_{\mathrm{ext}}$, corresponding to the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid as expected.
At the interface there is a peak in the tangential stress due to the anisotropy of the intermolecular forces in this region; this can be related to the interfacial tension.\cite{Marchand2011}
Furthermore, there is a change in the normal component at the interface, resulting from dependence of the Virial stress on density deviations in this region.

The time--averaged values for the stress were then used to estimate the derivative of the tangential stress with respect to temperature using Equation \ref{FinDiff}, as shown in Figure \ref{PisVirForce}.
This derivative shows a peak at the interface of the two fluids, providing the origin of the Marangoni force.
In the bulk of the fluid the derivative is zero within statistical error, ensuring there is no force acting in this region.
In addition, the derivative oscillates at the surface of the wall.
This can be interpreted as a thermophoretic force and is henceforth ignored.

\begin{figure*}[h!]

\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{PisVirForce}
\caption{The derivate of the tangential component of the Virial stress with respect to temperature was calculated using the finite difference approximation.
This shows a negative peak in the interfacial region.
When combined with a specified temperature gradient, a force in the opposite direction to a temperature gradient is generated, imitating the Marangoni force.
The oscillations at the liquid--solid surface create the thermophoretic force and are subsequently ignored.}
\label{PisVirForce}
\end{figure*}
\FloatBarrier

Using the central $1/3$ of the derivative profile and a temperature gradient of $\partial T^{*} / \partial x^{*} = 0.001$, an artificial Marangoni force was computed through Equation \ref{ForceStressTemp}.
This force was applied to an identical system prepared at $T^{*} = 0.85$.
An equilibrium simulation was then run for $40 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps, and the time--average of the x--component of the fluid velocity $v^{*}_{x}(z')$ was computed.
The momenta of the walls in the $x,y$ plane were fixed such that they provided a stationary reference point for the fluid, creating a momentum sink.

\caption{The velocity profile of a confined fluid at $T^{*}=0.85$ with an applied force calculated from Figure \ref{PisVirForce} was time--averaged over $40 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps of length $0.001\ \tau$.
A steady state negative interfacial peak emerges, corresponding to a Marangoni flow in the opposite direction to the temperature gradient.
The magnitude of the peak velocity is approximately 0.16 and this decays linearly to zero at the surface of the bounding walls, corresponding to a Couette flow.}
\label{PisVirFlow}
\end{figure*}
The fluid velocity profile is shown in Figure \ref{PisVirFlow}. 
There is a sharp negative peak at the interface indicating a Marangoni flow in the opposing direction to the temperature gradient.
Furthermore, the flow decays linearly away from the interface, consistent with a Couette flow arising from shear--driven fluid motion.\cite{FluidMech}

There is also a net flow in the system, suggesting an overall force acting on the fluid.
The walls in the system act as a momentum sink, providing a frictional force which allows this steady--state flow to arise under the isolated effect of a temperature--gradient.

\subsubsection{Comparing to the Irving--Kirkwood stress}
Figure \ref{PisVirStress} shows the normal component of the Virial stress is not uniform across the interface.
In contrast, the normal stress calculated using the Irving--Kirkwood formula does not depend on the local fluid density and should therefore be constant throughout the liquid.
To verify if the difference in these methods has a significant effect on the measurement of the Marangoni force, the Irving--Kirkwood stress was also calculated.

\begin{figure*}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{PisIKStress}
\caption{The Irving--Kirkwood stress tensor components for the combined fluid confined between two walls at $T^{*} = 0.8$ and $T^{*} = 0.9$ were time--averaged over $1 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps of length $0.001\ \tau$.
Both the normal and tangential stress show bulk values equal to $-P_{ext}$, representing the hydrostatic pressure.
Similar to Figure \ref{PisVirStress}, there is a peak in the tangential stress at the interface due to the anisotropy of the interparticle forces in this region.
However, this peak is divided into two with a reduction in the stress directly at the interface.
This difference to the Virial stress arises because the Irving--Kirkwood stress does not depend on the local density. 
The normal components of the stress are constant across the system, as expected.
}
\label{PisIKStress}
\end{figure*}
\FloatBarrier 
The fluids were prepared at $P^{*}=0.1$ and $T^{*}=0.8$ and $T^{*}=0.9$ as before.
Since the Irving--Kirkwood stress tensor was more computationally expensive (see Section \ref{CalcStress}), the equilibrium simulations were only run for $1 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps, resulting in a greater amount of statistical error.
This produced the time--averaged stress shown in Figure \ref{PisIKStress}.
The tangential component shows a similar profile to the Virial stress although the interfacial peak is divided into two with a reduction in the stress directly at the interface.
This difference directly at the interface arises since the Irving--Kirkwood does not depend on local density.
The normal component of the Irving--Kirkwood stress is constant throughout, representing the isotropy of the system in this direction.
\FloatBarrier

\begin{figure*}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{PisIKForce}
\caption{The derivate of the tangential component of the Irving--Kirkwood stress with respect to temperature was calculated using the finite difference approximation.
There is an analogous negative peak in the interfacial region to Figure \ref{PisVirForce}, with a similar magnitude and spatial extent.
However, the peak in the Irving--Kirkwood derivative is split into two.
This difference arises because, unlike the Virial stress, the Irving--Kirkwood stress does not depend on local density.
When combined with a specified temperature gradient, a force in the opposite direction to a temperature gradient is generated, imitating the Marangoni force.
The derivative in the bulk is zero, providing no body force acting on the fluid away from the interface.
}
\label{PisIKForce}
\end{figure*}
The finite difference method was again used to calculate the derivative of the stress with respect to temperature, and this is compared to the Virial result in Figure \ref{PisIKForce}.
Still focussing on the central $1/3$ of the fluid, there is a good correspondence between the two derivatives and the interfacial peak occurs both across the same spatial region and with the same maximum value.
The most significant difference occurs directly at the interface, where there is a sharp reduction in the derivative of the Irving--Kirkwood stress.
This is probably a result of the reduction in density at the interface affecting the Virial stress--tensor more than the Irving--Kirkwood stress--tensor.

\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{PisIKFlow}
\caption{The velocity profile of a confined fluid at $T^{*}=0.85$ with an applied force calculated from Figure \ref{PisIKForce} was time--averaged over $40 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps of length $0.001\ \tau$.
This is compared to the velocity profile produced using the force calculated from the Virial stress.
Both show a steady state negative interfacial peak, corresponding to a Marangoni flow in the opposite direction to the temperature gradient, with a linear decay into the bulk.
The peak value using the force calculated from the Irving--Kirkwood stress is not as large as that using the force calculated from the Virial stress.
This is a result of the reduction of the Irving--Kirkwood stress derivative directly at the interface.
Moreover, the Virial flow is symmetric about the interface whilst the Irving--Kirkwood flow is not. 
This is probably a result of the increase in noise in the Irving--Kirkwood derivative due to a shorter simulation time.}
\label{PisIKFlow}
\end{figure*}
Using a temperature gradient of $\partial T^{*} / \partial x^{*} = 0.001$ to compute the Irving--Kirkwood artificial body force, an equilibrium simulation at $T^{*} = 0.85$ was run for $40 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps.
The fluid velocity was measured and compared to the result obtained using the Virial force, as shown in Figure \ref{PisIKFlow}.
The profiles show a reasonably close correspondence, especially for the region $z' \leq 0.4$, although they deviate for higher values of $z'$.
In particular, the flow from the Irving--Kirkwood method is not as large directly at the interface, as a result of the reduction in the force at this point.
The Irving--Kirkwood velocity profile is also asymmetric despite the symmetry of the system.
This asymmetry may be the result of an increase in the noise of the Irving--Kirkwood force relative to the Virial force, which results from the shorter simulation time enforced by the high computational cost of the Irving--Kirkwood analysis.

\subsection{Binary--mixture periodic in 3-dimensions}
Equation \ref{NavierStokes} demonstrated that the existence of a temperature gradient in the system should not be able to generate a net flow in the fluid. 
Levich discusses this further, describing how the interfacial flow must be accompanied by a back-flow in the bulk fluid.\cite{Levich}
In the case of the binary--mixture held between two walls, the stationary walls provide a momentum sink which allows a net flow to exist within the fluid.
To replicate the behaviour of an infinite fluid where a back flow may be observed, a system void of momentum sinks must be studied.
For example, a binary--mixture of two partially miscible fluids with periodic boundary conditions in all dimensions can be used.

This system, shown in Figure \ref{AABB}, was prepared as described in Section \ref{SystemPrep} with the parameters given in Section \ref{InteractionModel}.
The distance between consecutive interfaces was $0.5 L_{z^{*}}$.
A Nos\'{e}--Hoover barostat and thermostat were used to control the pressure at $P^{*} = 0.1$ with temperatures of $T^{*}=0.8$ and $T^{*}=0.9$.

\subsubsection{Comparing the Virial and Irving--Kirkwood stress}
There is again an ambiguity over which stress--tensor should be used for computing the Marangoni force.
Once equilibrated, the system was simulated for $10 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps over which the number density, Virial and Irving--Kirkwood stress were computed.
As discussed before, the Irving--Kirkwood analysis was computationally expensive and this simulation length was the upper feasible limit.

The bulk density is uniform, representing a fluid state, and the interfaces manifest themselves as a sharp change in the densities of the two fluids.
Between the two temperatures the position of the interface is slightly shifted, this must be corrected before calculating the stress derivative.
}
\label{Period10Rho}
\end{figure}
After this period, the density profile (plotted in Figure \ref{Period10Rho}) showed a uniform density in the fluid bulk and a sharp interfacial region as expected.
However, the position of the interface shifted during the simulation and was no longer coincident for the two temperatures.
Before calculating the Marangoni force from the stress profile, this shift was removed by recentering the interfaces.

Both the normal and tangential stress show bulk values equal to $-P_{ext}$, representing the hydrostatic pressure.
There is a peak in the tangential stress at the interface due to the anisotropy of the interparticle forces in this region.

\label{Period10IKStress}
\end{figure}
The recentered Virial and Irving--Kirkwood stress profiles are plotted in Figures \ref{Period10VirStress} and \ref{Period10IKStress} respectively.
As with the fluid confined between two walls, the bulk stress components are equal to $-P_{\mathrm{ext}}$, corresponding to the hydrostatic fluid pressure.
There is an interfacial peak in both the Virial and Irving--Kirkwood tangential stress at the interface with a similar maximum value, although the Irving--Kirkwood stress shows a stronger minimum directly at the interface.
Similar to Figure \ref{PisIKStress}, this is probably the result of a reduced density in the interfacial region.
Furthermore, the normal component of the Irving--Kirkwood stress is clearly uniform across the interface, as expected.

\FloatBarrier
Using these stress profiles, the derivative of the stress with respect to temperature was calculated through the finite difference approach.
The derivative profile was adjusted by subtracting the average from each value, ensuring the integral over all space was zero, as shown in Figure \ref{Period10Force}.
This guaranteed there would be no net applied force acting on the fluid, even in the absence of a momentum sink in the system.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{Period10Force}
\caption{The derivate of the tangential component of the Irving--Kirkwood and Virial stress with respect to temperature was calculated using the finite difference approximation.

Both the Virial and Irving--Kirkwood stress derivatives show a negative peak at the interface, with a similar maximum value and spatial extent.
However, there is too much noise in these profiles, obscuring the fine structure and preventing a definitive comparison.
Furthermore, these derivatives are not precise enough to be useful for calculating an artificial body force.
}
\label{Period10Force}
\end{figure}
The derivative profile shows a similar interfacial peak to Figure \ref{PisIKForce}. 
The maximum values are similar, suggesting that fixing the total force to zero correctly adjusts the derivatives to give a physically meaningful Marangoni force.
Again, there is a reasonably good correspondence between the derivatives calculated from the Irving--Kirkwood and Virial stress tensors, and the magnitude of the Irving--Kirkwood peak is reduced directly at the interface.
In the bulk fluid, the derivative opposes the interfacial peak, generating the back force which balances the Marangoni force.
However, the profile as a whole shows too much noise for the fine--structure to be determined and is not of sufficient quality to be used in calculating an artificial body--force.

\subsubsection{Reducing the noise in the force--profile}
To generate a profile with a sufficiently low noise requires either a larger system size or a longer simulation time.
Both of these increase the computational cost of calculating the Irving--Kirkwood stress beyond a practical level, and instead the Virial stress must be used.
Considering how similar the Virial and Irving--Kirkwood derivative profiles appear in Figure \ref{PisIKForce}, using the Virial stress does not create too much deviation from the more suitable Irving--Kirkwood stress, whilst enabling a much longer simulation time.

This produced a significant reduction in noise relative to Figure \ref{Period10VirStress}.
As before, both the normal and tangential stress show bulk values equal to $-P_{ext}$, representing the hydrostatic pressure.

The normal component at the interface also deviates from the bulk value as a result of the dependence of the Virial stress on the local density.

The reduced noise stress was calculated by running the equilibrium systems for $30 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps.
Recentering the interfaces generated the Virial stress profile shown in Figure \ref{Period30VirStress}.
For both temperatures, the profiles show much less noise compared to Figure \ref{Period10VirStress}, especially in the bulk region, and the interfacial peaks are more symmetric.

Using these stress profiles, the derivative of the stress--tensor with respect to temperature was again computed using the finite difference and the average value subtracted to give the profile shown in Figure \ref{Period30VirForce}.
There is a dramatic reduction in the noise compared to Figure \ref{Period10Force}, with a sharp peak at the interface and an opposing stress derivative in the bulk regions.
\FloatBarrier

Using the stress derivative given in Figure \ref{Period30VirForce} and a temperature gradient of $\partial T^{*} / \partial x^{*} = 0.001$, an artificial body force was computed.
The body force was recentered to ensure the Marangoni peak was aligned with the interfacial region, and this was applied in an equilibrium simulation at $T^{*} = 0.85$.
This simulation was run for $40 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps, and $v^{*}_x(z')$ was computed to give the flow velocity plotted in Figure \ref{Period30VirFlow}.

\caption{The velocity profile of an infinite binary--mixture at $T^{*}=0.85$, with an applied force calculated using Figure \ref{Period30VirForce} and temperature gradient of $\partial T^{*} / \partial x^{*} = 0.001$, was time--averaged over $40 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps of length $0.001\ \tau$.
A non--equilibrium emerges with a non--zero average velocity (indicated by the hashed line), despite the average derivative being fixed to zero.
It is unlikely this could be removed without artificially fixing the centre--of--mass.
Despite this, the fluid velocity relative to this centre--of--mass motion suggests a Marangoni flow at the interfaces with an opposing flow in the bulk regions, as predicted by Levich.\cite{Levich}
}
\label{Period30VirFlow}
\end{figure}

Despite the simulation being run for a long timescale, the velocity profile still retains a lot of statistical noise.
It would be difficult practically to reduce this noise further.
Moreover, the average velocity (indicated by the hashed line) is non--zero, indicating centre--of--mass motion during the simulation.
This motion occurs even though the stress derivative has been adjusted to give no net force overall.
It is likely that in the absence of a momentum sink for a system like this, it would be very difficult to completely remove this net flow without artificially fixing the centre--of--mass throughout the simulation.

Despite this, the relative motion across the fluid can still be considered, and there does appear to be a velocity peak at the interface (with $v < v_{\mathrm{COM}}$), corresponding to a Marangoni flow, with a back flow in the bulk fluid (with $v > v_{\mathrm{COM}}$) as predicted.
This result is, however, somewhat ambiguous and there was insufficient time to improve this simulation further.

\subsection{The effect of surfactants}\label{SurfResult}
Surfactant molecules decrease the surface free energy of interfaces, as they have a favourable interaction with both fluids and bridge the interfacial plane.
This reduction in surface tension should also cause a decrease in the surface tension gradient and thus the Marangoni effect, as observed experimentally.\cite{KimSubramanianA,KimSubramanianB,BartonSubramanian,ChenStebe}

To model this, the non--ionic surfactant molecules described in Section \ref{ModellingSurfactants} were added to the binary--mixture confined between two walls.
This system was chosen since the results of Section \ref{Piston} showed it allowed a steady state flow to be generated and modelled effectively.

The surfactant molecules were added to a single plane between the two fluids in the initial lattice before melting.
A certain fraction of these molecules were then removed to vary the surfactant concentration, quantified as a fraction of the total number of fluid particles present,
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Surfactant\ Fraction} \equiv \frac{N_{\mathrm{surfactant}}}{N_{\mathrm{surfactant}}+N_{\mathrm{fluid}}}.
\end{equation}
This allowed the surfactant fraction to be varied between $0$ and $0.0323$.

Taking fractions of $0.000$, $0.0031$, $0.0098$, $0.0194$, $0.0264$, $0.0298$ and $0.0323$, the fluid was prepared as described in Section \ref{SystemPrep}, with a pressure of $P^{*}=0.1$ and temperatures of $T^{*}=0.8$ and $T^{*}=0.9$.
A piston barostat and Nos\'{e}--Hoover thermostat were used and each system was run at equilibrium for $30 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps of length $0.001\ \tau$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{SurfRho}
\caption{The number density for the confined binary--mixture with a non--ionic surfactant fraction of $0.0194$, pressure of $P^{*}=0.1$ and at $T^{*}=0.8$ was time--averaged over $30 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps of length $0.001\ \tau$. 
There is a uniform density in the bulk, and an interface represented by a sharp change in the densities of Fluid A and Fluid B.
The surfactant particles are localised at the interface with a low solubility.
They show the correct orientation, with `Head' particles interacting most strongly with Fluid A and `Tail' particles with Fluid B.
}
\label{SurfRho}
\end{figure}

The resulting number density of each species shows a uniform bulk density, a sharp interface and peaks for the head and tail groups located at the interface, as shown for $T^{*}=0.8$ and a surfactant fraction of $0.0194$ in Figure \ref{SurfRho}.
The surfactant molecules were correctly oriented with head groups interacting with Fluid A and tail groups with Fluid B.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{SurfForce}
\caption{The derivative of the tangential component of the Virial stress with respect to temperature was calculated for a range of surfactant fractions using the finite difference approximation.
For a low surfactant fraction, there is strong interfacial peak providing the origin of the Marangoni force.
As the amount of surfactant is increased, the strength of this peak decreases to zero indicating the eradication of the Marangoni effect.
Two smaller positive peaks on either side of the centre also develop for higher surfactant fractions.
This probably results from an increase in the number density in this region, due to localisation of the surfactant particles at the interface.
}
\label{SurfForce}
\end{figure}

The Virial stress was computed during the equilibrium simulations and used to compute the derivative of the stress with respect to temperature for each surfactant fraction.
These results, plotted in Figure \ref{SurfForce}, show a pronounced reduction in the magnitude of the interfacial peak as the surfactant fraction increases, corresponding to the expected reduction in the Marangoni force.

Two smaller positive peaks on either side of the centre also develop for higher surfactant fractions.
It is unclear exactly what these peaks correspond to.
They may simply be the result of an increase in the fluid density, due to localisation of the surfactant particles in this region and the dependence of the Virial stress on local density.
An increase in surfactant fraction would then exaggerate this density change.
In future, this could be verified by computing the Irving--Kirkwood stress, where any peaks due to density deviations should disappear.

Furthermore, the harmonic forces in the surfactant molecules may provide a contribution to these peaks in the stress.
The physical significance of this contribution could be investigated by varying the spring constant for the surfactant bond and noting any changes in the magnitude of these secondary peaks.

For a low surfactant fraction, the flow profile closely resembles that of the non--surfactant system (Figure \ref{PisVirFlow}, with a negative interfacial peak and a linear decay into the bulk.
As the amount of surfactant increases there is a reduction in the magnitude of this peak until the Marangoni flow essentially disappears.
Moreover, the peak becomes less sharp at higher surfactant fractions.
This is probably due to the non--uniform viscosity created by the added surfactant molecules.

Using a temperature gradient of $\partial T^{*} / \partial x^{*} = 0.001$, the central $1/3$ of the stress derivative profiles in Figure \ref{SurfForce} were used to compute an artificial body force, which was applied to simulations at $T^{*}=0.85$.
These were run for $30 \times 10^{6}$ timesteps over which $v_{x}(z')$ was measured and plotted in Figure \ref{SurfFlow}.
There is a clear decrease in the interfacial velocity as the surfactant fraction is increased, suggesting a retardation of the Marangoni effect induced by the surfactant molecules.

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{InterVel}
\caption{Comparing the surfactant fraction to the interfacial velocity demonstrates the retardation of the Marangoni flow in the presence of surfactant molecules.
Above a fraction of $0.025$, this velocity is essentially zero, although there is small velocity in the opposite direction to the Marangoni flow.
This may be the result of the secondary peaks that emerge in Figure \ref{SurfForce} which only become significant for high surfactant fractions.
}
\label{InterVel}
\end{figure}
The interfacial velocity can be taken as the peak of the flow shown in Figure \ref{SurfFlow}.
Comparing these values against the surfactant fraction shows a reduction in the magnitude of this peak value as the surfactant fraction increases, as shown in Figure \ref{InterVel}.
Above a fraction of $0.025$ it appears the Marangoni effect has been removed completely.
This retardation has been observed experimentally by Barton and Subramanian, and is discussed in their study on the relation between droplet size and upward motion under a vertical temperature gradient.\cite{BartonSubramanian} 
They note that droplets actually sink on the addition of a nonionic surfactant, indicating the eradication of the Marangoni force and the dominance of gravity.

\FloatBarrier
The sharpness of the Marangoni flow peak in Figure \ref{SurfFlow} also decreases as the surfactant fraction increases and no longer fits the Couette model as conclusively.
This may be a result of the reduction in viscosity at the interface due to the presence of surfactant molecules, giving a non-uniform viscosity across the fluid. 
To confirm this, the viscosity could be measured using the Green--Kubo relation,
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{1}{V k_{\mathrm{B}} T} \int_{0}^{\infty} \left< \sigma_{xy} \left( \tau \right) \sigma_{xy}(0) \right> \mathrm{d} \tau,
\end{equation}
providing a good basis for future work in this area.
