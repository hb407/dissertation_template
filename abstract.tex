The Marangoni flow induced by a temperature gradient at a liquid--liquid interface is studied through the use of equilibrium molecular--dynamics simulations for a symmetric Lennard--Jones binary--mixture.
An artifical Marangoni force is computed by considering the finite difference in the transverse component of the stress--tensor for two equilibrium simulations at different temperatures.
Applying this as a body force to an equilibrium simulation at an intermediate temperature allows the Marangoni flow profile to be computed.
This is demonstrated for a binary--mixture confined within a piston and a binary--mixture periodic in all dimensions. Because the atomic stress--tensor is not uniquely defined, the use of the Virial and Irving--Kirkwood stress--tensor is compared.
Finally, the method is used to observe the retardation of Marangoni flows due to the addition of surfactant molecules.
