The Marangoni flow induced by a temperature gradient at a liquid--liquid interface was studied through the use of equilibrium molecular--dynamics simulations for a symmetric Lennard--Jones binary--mixture.
An artifical Marangoni force was computed by considering the finite difference in the transverse component of the stress--tensor for two equilibrium simulations at different temperatures.
Applying this as a body force to a third equilibrium simulation at an intermediate temperature allowed the Marangoni flow profile to be computed.

This method was demonstrated for a binary--mixture confined between two walls and a binary--mixture periodic in all dimensions. Because the atomic stress--tensor is not uniquely defined, the use of the Virial and Irving--Kirkwood stress--tensor was compared.
Finally, the effect of adding surfactant molecules at the interface was studied, and a retardation of the Marangoni flow was observed.
