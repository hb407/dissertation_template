The Marangoni flow induced by a temperature gradient at a liquid--liquid interface is studied through the use of equilibrium molecular--dynamics simulations for a symmetric Lennard--Jones binary--mixture.
An artifical Marangoni force is computed by considering the finite difference in the stress--tensor for two equilibrium simulations at different temperatures.
Applying this as a body force to a non--equilibrium simulation at an intermediate temperature allows the Marangoni flow profile to be computed.
This is demonstrated for a binary--mixture confined within a piston and a binary--mixture periodic in all dimensions, and the use of the Virial or Irving--Kirkwood stress--tensor is compared.
Finally, the method is used to observe the retardation of Marangoni flows due to the addition of surfactant molecules.
